- [x] draw a body orbiting another body
- [x] make orbit speed relate to real math
  - [ ] simplify the math a lot to ease puzzle design
- [ ] allow choosing position (aka: assinging body to specific radius from central mass)
  - [ ] sat bodies
  - [ ] central body
  - [x] press a key ("o") to random assign which body has which radius (0, r1, r2)
  - [x] press a key ("r") to reset timestep to 0
- draw the orbital rings (light color circle/ellipse at various distances)
- for visual clarity, scale the size of circles according to their mass
